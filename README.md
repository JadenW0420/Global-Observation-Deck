git commit

Commit the staged snapshot. This will launch a text editor prompting you for a commit message. After youâ€™ve entered a message, save the file and close the editor to create the actual commit.

 
git commit -a

Commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory. This only includes modifications to tracked files (those that have been added with git add at some point in their history).

 
git commit -m "commit message"

A shortcut command that immediately creates a commit with a passed commit message. By default, git commit will open up the locally configured text editor, and prompt for a commit message to be entered. Passing the -m option will forgo the text editor prompt in-favor of an inline message.

 
git commit -am "commit message"
